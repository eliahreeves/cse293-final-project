2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/rmii_axis_0/inst/packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q[31]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_1_i/rmii_axis_0/inst/packet_gen_i/crc_gen_i/lfsr_q_reg[25]/PRE,

 (the first 15 of 32 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell design_1_i/axis_uart_0/inst/tx_data_fifo_i/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d2_reg in site SLICE_X15Y157 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDSE cell design_1_i/axis_uart_0/inst/tx_data_fifo_i/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d3_reg is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/axis_uart_0/inst/uart_tx_i/uart_tx_i_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/axis_uart_0/inst/uart_tx_i/uart_tx_i_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0, clkfbout_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0, clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0, clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
